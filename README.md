# ForgeMDK-Updated

All current Minecraft Forge MDKs listed [here](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/). They all have lombok and SpongePowered Mixin implemented/added, and example classes for them. You should be able to just import these projects as you would normal Gradle projects, and if they do not import properly (e.g. libraries missing), just run `setupDevWorkspace` or something like that from the Gradle tab (I am referring to [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)).

I believe that doing this could help a lot of beginners, especially people who want to create Forge mods for legacy versions such as 1.6.4 or 1.7.10.

Power to the players!
